6. Links to our Terms (https://kabirrgrover.github.io/flashchat-ai/terms.html) and Privacy Policy (https://kabirrgrover.github.io/flashchat-ai/privacy.html)

The exact welcome message is: "Hi! Welcome to FlashChat AI. I'm your conversational AI assistant. I can: Answer questions, Analyze images you send, Give beauty & style advice, Provide product suggestions. Reply with your question or send an image to start! Msg & data rates may apply.
